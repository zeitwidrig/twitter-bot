This is a very simple node.js app that powers the [@NoFreakingBot](https://twitter.com/NoFreakingBot) Twitter account.

## Credit
1. The affirmations as well as the `getRandomAffirmation` function were taken from [@annthurium's affirmations API](https://github.com/annthurium/affirmations).
2. The code for programmatically sending a tweet was taken from a [botwiki tutorial](https://botwiki.org/resource/tutorial/random-image-tweet/).
3. The generation of the access tokens for the bot was only possible due to this [article](https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-create-multiple-bots-with-a-single-twitter-developer-account-529eaba6a576). Because the [official Twitter docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens) are _kinda_ cryptic.
